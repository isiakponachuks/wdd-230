               <h2>What is Visual Hierachy</h2>
               <p>An efficient and smart web design requires cohesive, clear visual 
                   aids so that the visitor has quick and easy access to what they are looking for. 
                   Visual hierarchy in web design refers to the arrangement or presentation of elements in a way that implies importance and influences the order in which the human eye perceives what it sees. The theory behind it is that the human brain has 
                   “innate organizing tendencies that structure individual elements, shapes or forms into a coherent, organized whole.”</p>
                   <p>Disney has all the visual arrange better layout with typgraphy and pictures.</p>

            <h2>What is Contrast</h2>
            <p>Contrast in the context of visual design can be defined as a difference between two or more elements in a composition. The more the difference between the elements, 
                the greater they are easy to compare and comprehend and that's 
                when they are said to have contrasted with each other.</p>
                <p>Disney has an exceptional contrast visual that makes it typically clear and visible.</p>
